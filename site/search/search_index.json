These modules allow a designer to leverage STMicroelectronics STM32MP15x line of Microprocessors with flexible architecture of a Single/Dual Arm Cortex-A7 core running up to 800 MHz and Cortex\u00ae-M4 at 209 MHz combined with an option for dedicated 3D graphics processing unit (GPU) and MIPI-DSI display interface and a CAN FD interface along with the software stack in their own custom systems and form factors. The design of Logicboard 1 is loosely based on the STM32MP157-DK2 and for cost sensitive applications it can be supplied with a Single Core Processor and without the wireless fitted. The designer can interface the Logicboard 1 via three 70-pin high density connectors.
